# CS-3377-projects
These are codes from my CS 3377, progamming in an UNIX environment class

## Project 1 
This is a simple shell program that created a local shell when ran. It can take in command-line arguments, as well as piped commands.

## Project 2
This is a multi-threaded hashing program. It splits a given file along a binary thread tree starting from the root into blocks, hashes the block in the thread node, and parses the hashed value back to parent thread recursively for rehashing after appending it with the other child thread.

## Project 3
This is a project that simulates the client-server connection of websites and applications. Upon connecting to the server, client can store and retrieve data from the server.
